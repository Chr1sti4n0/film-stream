## Description 
  This application utilizes the Next.js framework, as well as GrapQL and GraphCMS. This is a clone of the popular streaming app, Disney+. The user (Chris) is presented with a banner of a randomly selected film from the created list and a row of the various genres that Disney+ provides. Clicking on the genres will scroll the page down to the associated genre. Each genre/category (family, Marvel, thriller, etc.) can be found by scrolling down the homepage. When a user selects a film, they are presented with a short synopsis of the film, its associated tags, a 'go back' and 'PLAY' button.
